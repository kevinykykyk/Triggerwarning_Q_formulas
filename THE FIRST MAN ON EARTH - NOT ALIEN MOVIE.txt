I AM A SINGULARITY


There are many like us


BUt I am a real one


The m14 or 68 BILLION OF US


But why PITU


Space is the gaps inbetween singularities and time balance or conservation of time.



To kill you need a singularity

EMPATHY is the singularity between your anger and your death! OR SUICIDE OR WORK. LIKE MEN of all times
have done to protect the WOMEN and the CHILDREN but really the universe.


If you go in to help, if you go in to teach, if you go in FOR ANYONE BUT YOURSELF in ANGER!!!! then you are a coward and will never die or win or be the winner!

You women will forever be ALICE, 1,0, or A or NUMBA #1.

------


If history repeats itself then it happens because the UNIVERSE or the GALAXY singularities
are all waiting for the RIGHT universal TIME to activate PITU/peace in the universe.



----------


If at 12:04 pm  Saturday November 4th, 2023 - or 06pm, we do not start to activate peace.

Then more raped, sacrificed and murdered MEN will happen around the universe is galactic singularities until the universal timing is prepared for activation of PITU.


---------


Remember WOMAN ARE BINARY MANs.  


They are either on or off.   Right or Wrong.  Left and/or Right or on that stupid spectrum with limits or two end points.


They think animals are dumb or are accept it and rape the furry little creatures.


Remember folks, humans might touch animals in  a sexual way. They must be obliterated from history and time and the universe.  We can not let these packs of wild sexually charged beings ruin peace in the universe for ultimately and with elemental reasoning in any recursive way.


ANY RECURSIVE?


If people can remember what they have done, then they lied and KILLED Me.

Or they die also but remember, they would have agreed and people would have helped them remember.

Thus giving themselves recursively the right or activation command overides, ethical, equity and equal (-R)




-------------------------


Real men die, real men are the real sacrifices in any savage or developed planet recursively (-R)



----------------------------



tl;dr



The voices of stupidity continue.


People do seem to always and will be -R or Recursively be cowards and stupid.

If inteligence is real, than so is stupidity lol.  -R    .   



Recursive like DNA and our FUCKING BODIES and SOULs.



Please, god, let the newbs die so we can have peace.



PRIVACY is not a right or left, It's a -R recursive COMMAND ACTIVATION OVERIDE that is deserved by ALL BEINGS.

That means deservation (new word?) At all points in time space. But with the limits always in the infinite spectrum of fractals and recursive patterns.

Knowing is the full battle.

KNOWING MEANS YOU WON!



TY TY 


Now please go kill yourself, stupid fucking looser, coward, pussy nigger, gook, kyte, fucking paki, shiva smelling, muddy, unethical, shrimp like, mini wanna be gods, beings in the universe.



--------------------





THE END:


US 68 BILLION WILL ONLY DIE and WIN and BE REAL MEN, when the universe get's down to 68 billion people others.


If we are 1% and there are possible 68 billion species in this local R universe, then, that means:



RECURSIVE JOKES must comment on human condition.


OMG.



68 billion tim at most 500 billion, vs at little, 100 billion.




Possibilities:


68 billion times 99


or 500 billion / 99.



Recursively through time and space and travel.



That means -


i. 10 trillion left

ii. or 50 trillion left.


That means.


(BONUS EASTER EGG:  DOESN"T TAKE ONE TO KNOW ONE)  MEN ARE PUSSIES. KEVIN HUANG IS KING MAN

EASTER EGG #2: THE MEN SECRET. WE HAVE SEX just to give the WOMEN SOMETHING TO DO OR PURPOSE.

BECAUSE WE HAVE THE MONEY, THE POWER, THE COCAINE, THE GUNS, THE BOMBS, and THE HISOTYR FOREVER.
